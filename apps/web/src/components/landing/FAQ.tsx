    question: "Is Readdly safe for my child?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Safety is our top priority. All stories are carefully curated and age-appropriate. We don't collect unnecessary personal data, use end-to-end encryption for all communications, and have robust parental controls. Your child can enjoy Readdly with complete peace of mind.",
  },
  {
    id: "p2",
    category: "parent",
    question: "How does Readdly adapt to my child's reading level?",
    answer:
      "Readdly uses AI to personalize every child's experience. When your child starts, they take a quick reading assessment. As they progress through stories and riddles, the platform learns their pace and interests, automatically adjusting story difficulty and hint complexity to keep them challenged but not frustrated.",
  },
  {
    id: "p3",
    category: "parent",
    question: "Can I track my child's progress?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! You get a dedicated parent dashboard showing reading time, stories completed, comprehension scores, skill growth, and milestones reached. You'll receive weekly progress reports by email and can set reading goals together with your child.",
  },
  {
    id: "p4",
    category: "parent",
    question: "What if my child gets stuck on a riddle?",
    answer:
      "Three levels of hints guide your child to the answer without giving it away. Hints progress from text-based clues to visual hints to audio hints. You can also enable 'help mode' to allow your child to request assistance while still learning problem-solving skills.",
  },
  {
    id: "p5",
    category: "parent",
    question: "Is there screen time control and offline reading?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can set daily reading time limits in parental controls, and Premium users can download up to 10 stories for offline reading. We also encourage reading breaks with our Safari mode for extended reading sessions.",
  },
  {
    id: "p6",
    category: "parent",
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "Readdly is free to get started with 5 stories and basic features. Premium Student ($9.99/month or $99/year) unlocks 50+ stories and adaptive learning. Premium Educator ($19.99/month or $199/year) includes classroom tools. All paid plans include a 14-day free trial with no credit card required.",
  },
  {
    id: "p7",
    category: "parent",
    question: "What age group is Readdly for?",
    answer:
      "Readdly is designed for children ages 6-11. Our algorithm ensures each child gets age-appropriate and reading-level-appropriate content, so a 6-year-old beginner and an 11-year-old advanced reader can both thrive on the same platform.",
  },
  {
    id: "p8",
    category: "parent",
    question: "Can multiple children use one account?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Family plans support up to 6 child profiles. Each child has their own reading level assessment, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations. This makes Readdly perfect for families with kids of different ages.",
  },
  {
    id: "t1",
    category: "teacher",
    question: "How can I assign stories to my class?",
    answer:
      "With Premium Educator, you can create a classroom in your dashboard and add up to 35 students. Assign stories, set deadlines, and organize reading by unit or theme. Students can read on their own schedules while you monitor progress in real-time.",
  },
  {
    id: "t2",
    category: "teacher",
    question: "Can I see analytics for my entire class?",
    answer:
      "Yes! The Educator Dashboard shows class-wide metrics: average reading time, completion rates, comprehension scores, and identify struggling or high-performing students. Compare performance across assignments and track skill development over time.",
  },
  {
    id: "t3",
    category: "teacher",
    question: "How does adaptive difficulty work for groups of students?",
    answer:
      "Each student in your class gets personalized difficulty based on their individual level. So when you assign a story, advanced readers face more challenging riddles while struggling readers get simpler versions. Everyone learns at their own pace together.",
  },
  {
    id: "t4",
    category: "teacher",
    question: "Can I create my own custom stories and riddles?",
    answer:
      "In our Educator Plus tier (launching Q2), you'll be able to upload your own stories and create custom riddles aligned to curriculum standards. For now, you can filter from our 50+ stories by reading level, theme, and learning objectives.",
  },
  {
    id: "t5",
    category: "teacher",
